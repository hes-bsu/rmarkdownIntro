## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. R Markdown can do the majority of things a typical word processing program (e.g., Microsoft Word), but requires a bit of knowledge about how the syntax works. There's a lot of help online, but the things I tended to use most when I first started were the RMarkdown Cheat Sheet and Reference guide (got to Help > Cheatsheets inside RStudio) and the [Markdown syntax page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).





You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
