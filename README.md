# Introduction to Rmarkdown
_based on the discussion on 5 Nov 2019, Jenny Bryan's [happygitwithr](https://happygitwithr.com/), and the [Data Analysis and Visualization](https://gge-ucd.github.io/R-DAVIS/index.html) course hosted by students at the University of California, Davis_

## "Gitting" started
1. _Clone this repository into RStudio_
    - Open RStudio
    - Go to File>New Project and choose the "Version Control" option
    - Select "Git" (Not Subversion)
    - paste the link from the "Clone Repository" button into the "Repository URL" space

This should create a folder on your computer with this file (README.md) and the Rmarkdown document we'll be working using for this example (FirstTry.Rmd).

2. Make sure you're up-to-date

  - Go to the "Git" tab in Rstudio (mine shows up in the same window as Environment, History, etc)

  - Click the "Pull" button to make sure you've cloned the most recent version
  
3. Open FirstTry.Rmd
